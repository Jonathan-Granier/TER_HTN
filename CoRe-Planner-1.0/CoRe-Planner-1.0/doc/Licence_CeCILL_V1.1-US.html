This
Agreement is a free software license that is the result of
discussions between its authors in order to ensure compliance with
the two main principles guiding its drafting:</P>
<ul>
<li> firstly,
its conformity with French law, both as regards the law of torts and
intellectual property law, and the protection that it offers to
authors and the holders of economic rights over software. 
</li>
<li>
secondly,
compliance with the principles for the distribution of free software:
access to source codes, extended user-rights.</li>
</ul>

<P>The
following bodies are the authors of the license CeCILL<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1anc" HREF="#sdfootnote1sym"><SUP>1</SUP></A></SUP>:</P>

<P>Commissariat

<h2>PREAMBLE</h2>

<P>The
purpose of this Free Software Licensing Agreement is to grant users
the right to modify and redistribute the software governed by this
license within the framework of an &ldquo;open source&rdquo;
distribution model.  
</P>

<P>The
exercising of these rights is conditional upon certain obligations
for users so as to ensure that this status is retained for subsequent
redistribution operations.</P>

<P>As a counterpart to the access to the source code and  rights to copy,
modify and redistribute granted by the license, users are provided only
with a limited warranty and the
software&rsquo;s author, the holder of the economic rights, and the
successive licensors only have limited liability.
</P>

<P>In
this respect, 
it is brought  to  the  user's  attention  that
the risks
associated with loading, using, modifying and/or developing or
reproducing the software by the user 
given its nature of Free Software, 
that may mean that it is complicated to manipulate,
and that also therefore means that it is reserved for developers and
experienced professionals having in-depth 
computer knowledge. Users are
therefore encouraged to load and test the Software&rsquo;s
suitability as regards their requirements in conditions enabling the
security of their systems and/or data to be ensured and, more
generally, to use and operate it in the same conditions 
of security. This Agreement may be freely reproduced and published,
provided it is not altered, and that no Articles are either added or
removed herefrom.</P>

<P>This
Agreement may apply to any or all software for which the holder of
the economic rights decides to submit the operation thereof to its
provisions.</P>
